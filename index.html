                    Hi, I'm Jonathan (Lin). <i>Professionally</i> speaking, I've been interested in the dynamics and applications of computers in all their forms, whether those be 
                    traditional von Neumann "grocery list" Turing machines, or alt/indie styles of computing like neuromorphic, deep learning, and reservoir computers. However, I generally
                    take thoroughly unpaid interests in nonlinear dynamics, chaos, and pattern formation - which appear in fractals, swarms, and cellular automata, among other things. Above, 
                    I've put links to toys and other things I've made for myself and others, with some hands-on ways to poke and prod at these beautiful things to learn more about them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, an MEng. in Bioengineering from the same, and I'm currently working in 
                    T-4 at Los Alamos National Laboratory on neuromorphic computing using memristors and other memory materials like photorefractive crystals with 
                    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/francescocaravelli/">Francesco Caravelli</a>. I've also animated a course in complex dynamics with the
                    <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a> using <a href='https://www.3blue1brown.com/'>Grant Sanderson's</a> <a href='https://github.com/3b1b/manim'>Manim</a> 
                    library (currently pending publication).

            <p>
                It would be downright generous to call me an early career researcher (at the <span title="September 2024">time of writing</span>, this is my second year doing work with the intent to publish), 
                but I do have a couple papers available on arXiv that are pending review, mainly from my year here at Los Alamos:

                        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20539">Memristive linear algebra.</a>

                        <span class="blurb">
                            <b>Full abstract:</b> A paper that explores hardware acceleration of matrix inversion, which is a very important operation used to
                            solve systems of equations, optimization problems, and differential equations. The hardware acceleration hinges on the amazing fact that
                            electric circuits can perform matrix-vector operations in one step (as opposed to O(N<sup>2</sup>) steps on a computer). Memristors are resistors 
                            that change their resistance based on their history of electric current flow, which allows for unique nonlinear applications.

                            <b>Full abstract:</b> Here, we aim to train a hardware neural network entirely on-chip, using only electric signals applied at the inputs and outputs of the network.
                            This is essentially learning with "minimal control" - by comparison, popular deep learning methods like backpropagation are like reaching into a brain and
                            painstakingly modifying neurons one-by-one. We take advantage of the unique properties of memristors, exploiting the fact that 1) memristors increase their 
                            resistance when current is passed through them and 2) that electricity follows the path of least resistance.
