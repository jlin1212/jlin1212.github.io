                    Takes a Julia set and <a href="julia.html">renders a 3D landscape</a>.
                    I may write some more about how this was done, but in brief the rendering is accomplished by raymarching a signed distance function derived from the Douady-Hubbard potential, which was used
                    to define an implicit surface that could be refined with classic Mandelbrot-style iteration. Actually even writing that was a lot of work, so maybe not. Just look at the code if you really care.

                    Define a 2D surface using a function of your own creation (default starter pictured).
                    Pick a starting point and <a href="gradbowl.html">watch how different optimizers behave in your landscape</a>.

                    A trick that Feynman references at least twice in his famous essay collection. What's all the hype about? Coming soon...
